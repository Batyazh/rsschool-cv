## About me:
For the last three years I have been working in a field that requires almost no study of new material and high intellectual abilities. 
Yes, it's simple, but over time you realize that you are not just not learning anything, you start to degrade. 
It was decided to go to the area where you need to study. Learns a lot. 
I think in the last couple of weeks, thanks to [rs school](https://rs.school/), 
I have learned more than in the last three years. And most importantly, I love it! I want more.
